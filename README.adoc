=== Getting help

*For users looking for help*: a manual describing all possible features of NeuralNetwork.NET is available in the app itself:
link:./docs/user/index.adoc[the docs folder].

Post any development questions or comments you may have on Stack Overflow and tag it with `[neuralnetworknet]`.
Don't hesitate to https://gitlab.com/oskopek/neuralnetworknet/issues[open an issue].

=== Running NeuralNetwork.NET releases

* Download a release from https://gitlab.com/oskopek/neuralnetworknet/tags[]

==== Linux with `dotnet`

* Download the *source archive*: `neuralnetworknet-VERSION-src.zip`
* Extract it using your favourite archive tool: `unzip neuralnetworknet-VERSION-src.zip`
* `cd` into the extracted directory and execute `dotnet run`.

==== Windows with `.NET Core`

*TODO*

=== Building & running NeuralNetwork.NET

* See the section (further down) on How-to setup your *build environment* first.
* *Recommended*: `./clean.sh; dotnet restore; ./build-all.sh; dotnet run`
* To run *unit tests*: `./test-all.sh`
//* To run *integration tests*: `./test-all-integration.sh`
* To *clean*, run: `./clean.sh`
* *Run NeuralNetwork.NET*:
** If you followed the build environment setup and want to run your version of NeuralNetwork.NET,
run `dotnet run` from the main project directory.

NeuralNetwork.NET uses http://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

=== Setup your build environment

==== Linux & Mac

. *Install Git*
** Fedora: `sudo dnf install git`
** Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git`

. *Install .NET Core >= 1.0.0* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)
** *NOTE*: You need `jdk-8u40` or newer (JavaFX 8 dependency).

. *Fork the repository* -- Create a fork of the link:https://gitlab.com/oskopek/neuralnetworknet/[oskopek/neuralnetworknet repository]
(right upper corner) on gitlab, usually the fork will be called: `yourusername/neuralnetworknet`.

. *Clone the your fork* -- run `git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/neuralnetworknet.git`
 (or, preferably, use SSH: `git clone git@gitlab.com:yourusername/neuralnetworknet.git`)

. *Run the build* (see the Building section)

==== Windows

. *Install .NET Core >= 1.0.0*
.. *TODO*

. *TODO* Install Git

. Find the `oskopek/neuralnetworknet` https://gitlab.com/oskopek/neuralnetworknet[repository] on gitlab.

. Create a fork of the repository (right under the project name), usually the fork will be called `yourusername/neuralnetworknet`.

. *Run the build* (see the Building section)

.. After testing your changes, submit a merge request to `oskopek/neuralnetworknet` through https://gitlab.com/oskopek/neuralnetworknet/merge_requests/new[gitlab].
... Click on compare across forks.
... Set the following:
**** base fork: `oskopek/neuralnetworknet`
**** base: `master`
**** head fork: `yourusername/neuralnetworknet`
**** compare: `branchname`

.. Click on *Click to create a merge request for this comparison*.

.. Our GitLab continuous integration will test the merge of your merge request.
You can view the results in the thread of the merge request.

.. Congratulations! Your merge request will get reviewed and probably be merged in.
