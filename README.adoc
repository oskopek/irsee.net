* Download a release from https://gitlab.com/oskopek/mff-csharp-project/tags[]
* To directly run mff-csharp-project, download the *executable JAR file*: `mff-csharp-project-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
* If you want to run a release, just try: `java -jar mff-csharp-project-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

=== Building & running mff-csharp-project

* See the section (further down) on How-to setup your *build environment* first.
* *Recommended*: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
* To run *unit tests*: `mvn clean install`
* To run *integration tests*: `mvn clean install -Pit`
* To *clean*, run: `mvn clean`
* *Run mff-csharp-project*:
** If you followed the build environment setup and want to run your version of mff-csharp-project,
run `mvn exec:java` from the main project directory.
** If you want to run a translated version of mff-csharp-project, set your system locale accordingly and restart mff-csharp-project.
If you want to try out a translated version (on Linux), try: `LC_ALL="LOCALE" java -jar mff-csharp-project.jar`, where
`LOCALE` is any locale available on your system (run `locale -a` to view all available).

mff-csharp-project uses http://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

. *Fork the repository* -- Create a fork of the link:https://gitlab.com/oskopek/mff-csharp-project/[oskopek/mff-csharp-project repository]
(right upper corner) on gitlab, usually the fork will be called: `yourusername/mff-csharp-project`.

. *Clone the your fork* -- run `git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/mff-csharp-project.git`
 (or, preferably, use SSH: `git clone git@gitlab.com:yourusername/mff-csharp-project.git`)

. *Run the build* (see the Building section)

==== Windows

. *Install Java8 JDK* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)

. *Install Maven* -- (preferably the latest version you can).

.. After testing your changes, submit a pull request to `oskopek/mff-csharp-project` through https://gitlab.com/oskopek/mff-csharp-project/compare[gitlab].
... Click on compare across forks.
... Set the following:
**** base fork: `oskopek/mff-csharp-project`
**** base: `master`
**** head fork: `yourusername/mff-csharp-project`
**** compare: `branchname`

.. Click on *Click to create a pull request for this comparison*.

.. Our Travis continuous integration server will test the merge of your pull request.
You can view the results in the thread of the pull request.
